# Software aim

PEOC is Python software which aims to simulate and estimate the parameters of the chalara model of the article 'Mechanistic-statistical model for the expansion of ash dieback' by Coralie Fritsch, Marie Grosdidier, Anne Gégout-Petit and Benoît Marçais. It allows to reproduce the simulations made in this article, which is available at the following url [https://hal.science/hal-04690647](https://hal.science/hal-04690647).

# Usage

To run simulations :
- check the Python version of your computer, then, 
- in a terminal, go in the current directory,
- run the script main_script.py in the terminal using the Python 2 call
associated to your computer version
	ex : ````python main_script.py````	or	````python2.7 main_script.py````

The script 'main_script' allows to realize simulations with news parameters (which are to be enter in the global_parameters files) or to realize additional actions for an old set of parameters.

The possible actions are:
- New run of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (additional iterations can be added to already
performed run) 
- New run of the AMIS (Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling) algorithm (additional iterations can be added to already performed run)  
- Realization of graphs of performed simulations (including posterior distributions, dynamics  of model with the set of parameters having the maximal likelihood...)
- Computation of the RMSE for the parameters set of an existing simulation with the highest likelihood
- Plotting graphs comparing the iteration evolution of different Metropolis-Hastings algorithm runs
- Plotting graphs comparing the posterior distributions of different AMIS algorithm runs
- Computation of the likelihood on a regular grid
- Plotting the likelihood computed on a regular grid

Run the script 'main_script' and follow the instruction in the preamble before to select an action. 
In particular, for new runs of the Metropolis-Hastings or the AMIS algorithm, the parameters  have to be enter in the file 'parameters_of_the_model.py' and  '1_or_2_parameters_of_the_AMIS_or_MH_algorithm.py'. 
For graph comparing the iteration evolution of different Metropolis-Hastings algorithm runs,  open the script '6_simulations_MH_to_compare.py' and follow the instruction in the preamble to indicate which runs have to be compared. 
For graphs comparing the posterior distributions of different AMIS algorithm runs, open the script '7_simulations_AMIS_to_compare' and follow the instruction in the preamble to indicate which runs have to be compared.
For new computations of the likelihood on a regular grid, the parameters have to be enter in the  file 'parameters_of_the_model.py' and '8_parameters_for_computation_on_regular_grid'. 
For graphs the likelihood computed on a regular grid, open the script  '9_graph_log_likelihood_on_regular_grid' and follow the instruction in the preamble to indicate which runs have to be plotted.

# Description of the model

The model is described at https://hal.science/hal-04690647.
It is composed of three sub-models:
(1) a reaction-diffusion model describing the expansion of leaf infection by H. fraxineus and the subsequent colonization of leaf debris in the litter (rachis). This model includes effect of the ash density, the impact of the rainfall and an Allee effect.
(2) a stochastic model describing the development of dieback symptoms as a function of leaf spore infection. This model takes into account temperature effects.
(3) a stochastic model describing observation data as a function of symptoms and quadrats visited. 

# Data

Environmental data:
The climatic data (rainfall and temperatures) are given in the file 'climate_data'. Its corresponds to aggregated data of [Safran data from Météo-France](https://meteo.data.gouv.fr).
The density of ashes is given in the file 'density.txt'. These values are derived from the [IGN data](https://inventaire-forestier.ign.fr/dataifn/) from 2006 to 2015.

Observation data:
The file 'data_chalara_2008_2023.txt' contains the observation data obtained by the [Département de la Santé des Forêts (DSF)](https://agriculture.gouv.fr/le-departement-de-la-sante-des-forets-role-et-missions).

In both files, the column 'quadrat' contains the extended lambert II coordinates of the center of the quadrat.

The inputs of action 1 are to be entered in the file parameters_of_the_model.py and in the file 1_or_2_parameters_of_the_AMIS_or_MH_algorithm. The former one contains the model parameter as well as the discretisation parameter of the reaction-diffusion equation. The latter one contains the parameters of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (initialization, prior distribution, proposal distribution).

The output of action 1 are 
- sampled_parameters.npy which contains an array of size (N_MH+1,10) where the variable (0,:) is the initial parameter and the variable (i,:) is the (i+1)-th parameter by the algorithm and with N_MH the number of iterations of the algorithm.
- log_likelihood.npy which contains an array of size N_MH +1 where the i-th entry is the log- likelihood of the i-th tested parameter.
- acceptation_rate.npy which contains an array of size N_MH +1 where the i-th entry is the acceptation of the algorithm from iteration 0 to i.

The  algorithm automatically detects the algorithm which was previously run.
